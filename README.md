# Earthquake Visualization

This project showcases a dynamic visualization of earthquake data spanning from 1905 to 2007, sourced from NASA and USGS. It offers an interactive experience allowing users to seamlessly switch between a 2D map view and a 3D globe view. Below is an overview of the project's key features and functionalities:

## Project Highlights:

1. Flat Map and Globe Mesh Creation
Developed a flat map mesh subdivided into multiple triangles to represent Earth's surface.
Utilized precise calculations for vertices and normals.
Implemented texture mapping to enhance visual appeal.
2. Smooth Morphing Effect
Seamlessly transitions between the flat map and the spherical globe representation.
Provides a visually pleasing and intuitive user experience.
3. Earthquake Marker Visualization
Displays earthquake markers accurately on the Earth's surface.
Dynamically adjusts marker appearance based on magnitude for better insight.
4. Additional Enhancements (Wizardry):
Implemented advanced features beyond basic requirements.
Possible enhancements include Earth rotation animation, axial tilt simulation, and interactive elements for user engagement.
Leveraged monthly Earth texture images and elevation data to enrich the visualization.
